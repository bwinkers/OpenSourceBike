# Open Source Bike

__A collection of open source bicycle projects__

This site will provide information about open source bicycle initiatives around the world.

The immediate goal will be publishing Giannis, an open source smart bike solution using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

We'll also want to suport open source hardware solutions. We'll collect or produce open source CAD and 3d printer component and battery designs. The hope being that people could take those plans to local builders and in the process create new local economies around ebikes.

## Software 

Pretty much everything below is **experimental** and geared towards hackers and builders.

### Giannis - Smart ebike powered by RPi and Arduino.

[Giannis](https://github.com/bwinkers/opensourcebike/wiki/Giannis---The-ultimate-in-ebike-defense-and-control) is an open source Bike project. It will provide tracking, navigation and manage the bikes lights, horns and sensors. The software is designed for Raspberry Pi and Arduino so people can build and support their own devices.

## Hardware

We'll provide CAD files, 3d printer files, electronic board designs and anything else that would allow shops and individualks to create and maintain their own ebikes and bicycles. (snail bikes? lol)

### Frame Designs

### Wheel Designs

### BMS

### Controller

### Sensors

## Open Source Bike Sharing

## Previous Efforts

These are other now-defunct projects in the open source area, or that helped inspired current open source offerings.
